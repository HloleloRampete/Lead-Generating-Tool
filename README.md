## Lead Collector Chrome Extension

#### Project Overview
The Lead Collector Chrome Extension is a tool designed to assist Sales Representatives and small business owners in efficiently collecting and managing leads. It allows users to save email addresses, websites, profile links, and other relevant information for potential leads directly from their browser.

#### Why I Created This Specific Tool
Having worked in the sales division of a branding company, where I sold various marketing materials and billboards, I understand the challenges faced by sales professionals in managing leads effectively. Inspired by my own experiences, I created this tool to streamline the lead collection process and provide a convenient solution for sales agents and small business owners.

#### Mastery Points
- **JavaScript Functions**: Utilized JavaScript functions to implement core functionalities such as saving lead information, testing for truthy or falsy values in local storage, and rendering lead data.
- **Working with Local Storage**: Leveraged local storage to persist lead data across browser sessions, enabling users to access and manage their leads efficiently.

#### Challenges
One of the main challenges encountered during the development of the Lead Collector Chrome Extension was enhancing its interactivity. Specifically, I aimed to make the tool more interactive by allowing users to edit the saved lead data. Implementing this feature required careful consideration of data handling and user interface design to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience.

#### Conclusion
While the Lead Collector Chrome Extension provides a foundation for efficient lead management, there is room for improvement to enhance its functionality further. Future iterations of the tool will focus on refining the user interface, implementing additional features such as lead editing capabilities, and optimizing performance for a smoother user experience. By continuously iterating and refining the tool, I aim to provide sales professionals with a valuable resource that meets their evolving needs and challenges.
